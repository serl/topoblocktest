# OVS-playground

## Installation
You need:

* Python > 3.4.2
* the dependencies for the dependencies (scipy): `sudo apt-get install gfortran libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev`
* Open vSwitch ~2.3.0
* Docker ~1.10.2

Configure the environment with `source .env`; it will also install the dependencies. Exit the pyenv (and restart using you're good ole Python version) by running `deactivate`.
